# Dancing Pony

## Prerequisite
- Install docker on host machine

## Getting Started with Docker

```bash
# Create a .env file by copying example values
cp .env.example .env

# start Docker service (Postgres, Redis, Application with hot reload)
make dc-up
```

## Getting Started without Docker
```bash
# Create a .env file by copying example values. Make sure to replace Postgres and Redis with correct credentials
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build binary and start application
make start
```


## Help command
```bash
make help
```

At this time, you have a RESTful API server running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. It provides the following endpoints:

* `POST /api/v1/login`: Authenticates a user and generates a JWT
* `POST /api/v1/register`: Register a user
* `GET /api/v1/dishes`: Returns a paginated list of the dishes
* `GET /api/v1/dishes/:id`: Returns the detailed information of a dish
* `POST /api/v1/dishes`: Creates a new dish
* `PUT /api/v1/dishes/:id`: Updates an existing dish
* `DELETE /api/v1/dishes/:id`: deletes a dish
* `POST /api/v1/ratings`: Add a rating on a dish

Try the URL `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser, and you should see something like `"OK"` displayed.

If you have `cURL` or some API client tools (e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)), you may try the following
more complex scenarios:

```shell
# Register new user via: POST /api/v1/register
curl --location '127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/auth/register' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Norby",
    "password": "secret",
    "nickname": "Baru",
    "email": "norby@example.com"
}'
# Should return user information created in JSON format

# authenticate the user via: POST /api/v1/login
curl --location '127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/auth/login' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "norby@example.com",
    "password": "secret"
}'
# should return a JWT token like: {"access_token":"...JWT token here..."}

# with the above ACCESS token, access the dish resources, such as: GET /api/v1/dishes
curl --location '127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/dishes' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}'
# should return a list of dishes in the JSON format
```

### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a restaurant REST API using Go and any framework.

### Brief

Frogo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire, has a great idea. He wants to build a restaurant that serves traditional dishes from the world of Middle Earth. The restaurant will be called "The Dancing Pony" and will have a cozy atmosphere.

Frogo has hired you to build the website for his restaurant. As payment, he has offered you either a chest of gold or a ring. Choose wisely.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **Go**
    -   Framework: **any framework**
-   Implement a REST API returning JSON
-   Implement a custom user model with a "nickname" field
-   Implement a dish model. Each dish should have a name, description, image, and price.
    -   Choose the appropriate data type for each field
    -   Add validation to the dish model fields to ensure that the name and description fields are unique
-   Provide an endpoint to authenticate with the API using username, password and return a JWT
-   Provide REST resources for the authenticated user for the Dish resource
    -   Implement the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for this resource:
        -   **Create**: Allow authenticated users to create new dishes
        -   **Read**: Allow authenticated users to view details of specific dishes, as well as a list of dishes
            -   Make the List resource searchable with query parameters
            -   Implement pagination for the /dishes resource. Allow users to set a limit and offset for the number of dishes returned in the response
        -   **Update**: Allow authenticated users to update dishes
        -   **Delete**: Allow authenticated users to delete dishes
    -   Implement an endpoint to rate a dish (POST)
        -   Store the rating on the Dish model
    -   Implement rate limiting for the /dishes resource to prevent abuse

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Go** best practices
-   Make sure that users can only rate dishes once
-   Bonus: Make sure the user _Sm√©agol_ is unable to rate any dish at "The Dancing Pony"
-   Bonus: Write an API test for the rating endpoint

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

Best of luck, and happy coding!
